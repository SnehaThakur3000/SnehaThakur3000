My GitHub Journey

Hi! I’m Sneha Thakur . I’m learning to code and starting to build my GitHub portfolio. Here’s a little about what I’m focusing on:

 Current Learning Goals
- Languages: Python, C, etc.
- Skills: Basic programming, data structures, algorithms
- Projects in Progress: Simple console applications, small scripts, or challenges from coding platforms

 Future Projects
I plan to work on:
- A calculator app
- A to-do list web app
- Games using Python, like a basic tic-tac-toe or guessing game

 Contact
Feel free to reach out! I’m always open to connecting with others on the same journey.
